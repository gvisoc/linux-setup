## Acceptance Criteria
The review process should include creating a Virtual Machine with virtualbox and running the scripts from a fresh installation. The criteria to be accepted would be no errors in such a run.

All packages or tarballs, zips, etc., should be signed or their signatures / hashes / checksums checked accordingly. PPAs hosted in https://launchpad.net will fall into this category (i.e., accepted) as, although they might be unofficial / unsupported, they have signing keys. Same applies for any package existing in `snapd` default stores; although obviously their usage and the satisfaction onbtained from random packages is under each user's criteria and risk.

This obviously excludes any hardware-specific scripts that I wouldn't be able to reproduce (e.g., for non-Thinkpad laptops).

You are free to fork the repository as per the License should you wouldn't agree with the above.
